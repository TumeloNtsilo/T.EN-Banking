# Simple-Banking 🏛
A simple banking python code 🐍.

This project is a simple command-line banking system developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and view account information. The system simulates basic banking functionality and is ideal for learning and practicing Python OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
